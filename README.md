## Python CLI Tool to Generate Isomer Websites

Clone this repo into your computer - go to the generate-site directory. Run the following in your CLI.

```
# Currently in [path]/generate-site/

python generate-site.py
```

Follow the instructions in the prompt. After completing the steps, you should see the `isomerpages-[new-repo]` folder in the parent directory, i.e. ../isomerpages-[new-repo].

To preview the website on localhost, run (you will need to have installed Jekyll):
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Note: Currently works with Python 2
